# macOS CI/CD Fix - Quick Reference
**Status:** ✅ READY TO COMMIT

## 🎯 What Was Done

Fixed 5 critical issues preventing macOS CI/CD tests from passing:

1. ✅ **Windows DLL checks fail on macOS** → Made platform-aware
2. ✅ **Execute permissions lost after artifact download** → Added `chmod +x` step
3. ✅ **No Unix permission verification** → Added stat-based checks
4. ✅ **No build verification** → Added post-build validation
5. ✅ **Windows-centric file checks** → Made conditional

## 📝 Files Modified

### 1. `tests/test_dist_build/test_built_libraries.py`
- **3 changes**: Platform-aware DLL checks, Unix permissions, file accessibility
- **Lines**: 97-107, 141-157, 411-428
- **Impact**: Tests work on both Windows and macOS

### 2. `.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml`
- **2 changes**: Build verification step, permission restoration step
- **Lines**: 109-133, 223-228
- **Impact**: Executable permissions preserved through artifact workflow
