## üîß Configuration

### GitHub Secrets

The workflow uses **GitHub Artifacts exclusively** and requires **no external secrets** for basic operation.

Optional secrets for advanced features:

| Secret | Description | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| `SIGNING_CERT` | Code signing certificate | Optional: Sign executables |
| `SLACK_WEBHOOK` | Slack notifications | Optional: Build notifications |
| `GH_TOKEN` | GitHub token | Optional: Create GitHub Releases |

### Environment Variables

Edit `.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml` to customize:

```yaml
env:
  PYTHON_VERSION: "3.9"  # Change Python version
  SPEC_FILE: "ZyraVideoAgentBackend-minimal.spec"  # Change spec file
  TEST_SCRIPT: "tests/test_dist_build/run_all_tests.py"  # Change test script
```

### Customizing the Workflow

**Change artifact retention:**
```yaml
- name: Upload canary artifact
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: zyra-windows-canary-${{ github.sha }}
    path: canary-release/
    retention-days: 7  # Change to desired days
```

**Add external deployment (optional):**
```yaml
- name: Deploy canary to external server
  run: |
    # Optional: Deploy artifacts to your own infrastructure
    aws s3 cp canary-release/ s3://your-bucket/canary/ --recursive
```

**Change artifact retention:**
```yaml
- name: Upload artifact
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    retention-days: 7  # Change number of days
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Workflow Fails at Build Job

**Problem:** Dependencies not installing

**Solution:**
```bash
# Test locally
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
pyinstaller ZyraVideoAgentBackend-minimal.spec --clean --noconfirm
```

### Workflow Fails at Test Job

**Problem:** Tests not passing

**Solution:**
```bash
# Run tests locally
python tests/test_dist_build/run_all_tests.py
# Review test_report.json for specific failures
```

### Can't Download Artifacts

**Problem:** Artifacts expired or not found

**Solution:**
- Check artifact retention period (default: 7 days for builds)
- Ensure job completed successfully (green checkmark)
- Check if workflow run was for correct branch

### Artifacts Not Created

**Problem:** Canary/production artifacts missing

**Solution:**
- These artifacts are only created for `main` branch pushes
- Check you're on the `main` branch
- Verify the package jobs completed successfully
- Check workflow logs for any failures

### "No space left on device" Error

**Problem:** Runner storage full

**Solution:**
- Use GitHub-hosted runners (refreshed each run)
- Or clean up self-hosted runner storage
- Or use `actions/cache` to manage dependencies

## üîê Security Best Practices

### 1. Protect Secrets

- Mark secrets as **"Secrets"** not variables
- Use environment-specific secrets when possible
- Rotate secrets regularly

### 2. Environment Protection

- Require reviewers for production deployments
- Limit deployment branches (main only)
- Use deployment logs for audit trail

### 3. Code Signing (Recommended)

**Windows:**
```yaml
- name: Sign executable
  run: |
    signtool sign /f cert.pfx /p ${{ secrets.CERT_PASSWORD }} dist/ZyraVideoAgentBackend.exe
```

**macOS:**
```yaml
- name: Sign executable
  run: |
    codesign --force --deep --sign "Developer ID" dist/ZyraVideoAgentBackend
```

### 4. Branch Protection

1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Branches**
2. Add rule for `main` branch
3. Enable:
   - Require pull request reviews
   - Require status checks (build & test)
   - Require branches to be up to date

---

## üéØ Best Practices

### 1. Branch Strategy

```
main      ‚Üí Full pipeline + production deployment (with approval)
develop   ‚Üí Full pipeline + canary deployment (with approval)
feature/* ‚Üí Build + test only
```

### 2. Deployment Checklist

Before approving production deployment:

- [ ] All tests pass (100%)
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Canary monitoring successful
- [ ] No critical bugs in issues
- [ ] Release notes prepared

### 3. Using GitHub Releases

Create releases for production deployments:

```bash
# After successful production deployment
gh release create v1.0.0 \
  --title "Release v1.0.0" \
  --notes "Release notes here" \
  artifacts/ZyraVideoAgentBackend/*
```

## üí° Tips & Tricks

### Speed Up Workflows

1. **Use caching** (already enabled):
   ```yaml
   - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
     with:
       cache: 'pip'  # Caches pip dependencies
   ```

2. **Skip CI for docs**:
   ```yaml
   on:
     push:
       paths-ignore:
         - '**.md'
         - 'docs/**'
   ```

3. **Matrix builds** for multiple Python versions:
   ```yaml
   strategy:
     matrix:
       python-version: ['3.9', '3.10', '3.11']
   ```

### Reduce Costs

1. **Use GitHub-hosted runners for public repos** (unlimited)
2. **Self-host for private repos** (no minute charges)
3. **Limit workflow triggers**:
   ```yaml
   on:
     push:
       branches: [main, develop]
       paths:
         - 'backend/**'
         - 'requirements.txt'
   ```

### Improve Visibility

1. **Add status badge to README**:
   ```markdown
   ![Build Status](https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/massugc-video-service/actions/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml/badge.svg)
   ```

2. **Enable email notifications**:
   - Go to **Settings ‚Üí Notifications**
   - Enable **Actions** notifications

3. **Add Slack notifications**:
   ```yaml
   - name: Notify Slack
     if: always()
     run: |
       curl -X POST ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }} \
         -d '{"text":"Build ${{ job.status }}"}'
   ```
