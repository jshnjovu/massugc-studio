# GitHub Actions CI/CD - Immediate Actions Required
## ZyraVideoAgentBackend Deployment Readiness

**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Architect:** Winston  
**Status:** 🚦 Ready to Deploy (Actions Required)

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

Your GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline has been **thoroughly analyzed** and is **90% production-ready**. 

**Critical Fix**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Platform-specific test script fixed  
**Remaining**: Configure GitHub Environments for approval workflow

**Estimated Time to Production**: 15 minutes

---

## ✅ What's Been Fixed

### Critical Issue #1: Platform-Specific Executable Check
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

**File**: `tests/test_dist_build/run_all_tests.py`

**Problem**: Test script hardcoded `.exe` extension, which would fail on macOS

**Solution Applied**:
```python
# BEFORE (Line 230)
exe_path = dist_dir / "ZyraVideoAgentBackend" / "ZyraVideoAgentBackend.exe"

# AFTER (Lines 231-232)
exe_name = "ZyraVideoAgentBackend.exe" if platform.system() == "Windows" else "ZyraVideoAgentBackend"
exe_path = dist_dir / "ZyraVideoAgentBackend" / exe_name
```

**Impact**: macOS tests will now pass prerequisite checks ✅

---

## 📋 Immediate Actions Required

### Step 1: Commit the Test Script Fix (2 minutes)

```bash
# Add the fixed test script
git add tests/test_dist_build/run_all_tests.py

# Commit the fix
git commit -m "Fix: Make test script platform-aware for macOS builds

- Add platform detection for executable name
- Use .exe extension on Windows, no extension on macOS
- Ensures test prerequisites pass on both platforms"

# Push to current branch
git push origin unifiedbuild
```

**Expected Result**: Test script fix is in repository ✅

```bash
# Make a small change to trigger workflow
echo "# CI/CD Pipeline Active" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Test: Trigger CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin unifiedbuild
```

**Expected on `unifiedbuild`**:
- ✅ Build jobs run (Windows + macOS)
- ✅ Test jobs run
- ✅ Package jobs run
- ⏹️ Canary jobs **SKIP** (main branch only)
- ⏹️ Production jobs **SKIP** (main branch only)

**Option B: Merge to main** (Full Pipeline)
```bash
# When ready for full deployment test
git checkout main
git merge unifiedbuild
git push origin main
```

**Expected on `main`**:
- ✅ Build jobs run
- ✅ Test jobs run
- ✅ Package jobs run
- ⏸️ **PAUSE** for canary approval
- ⏸️ **PAUSE** for production approval (after canary)

#### 4.2 Watch Workflow Progress
1. Go to: https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/massugc-video-service/actions
2. Click on the latest workflow run
3. Watch jobs execute in real-time

#### 4.3 Expected Timeline (First Run, No Cache)

- `test-report-windows-[sha]` (Test results)
- `test-report-macos-[sha]` (Test results)
- `zyra-windows-release-[sha]` (Release package)
- `zyra-macos-release-[sha]` (Release package)

**On `main` branch (after approvals)**:
- All of the above, PLUS:
- `zyra-windows-canary-[sha]` (Canary release)
- `zyra-macos-canary-[sha]` (Canary release)
- `canary-monitoring-report-[sha]` (Monitoring data)
- `zyra-windows-production-[sha]` (Production release)
- `zyra-macos-production-[sha]` (Production release)

4. Click artifact name to download ZIP
5. Extract and verify contents

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Workflow doesn't trigger
**Solution**: 
- Verify Actions are enabled: **Settings → Actions → General**
- Check workflow file is in `.github/workflows/`
- Ensure branch name matches trigger conditions

### Issue: Build fails
**Solution**:
- Check Python version (should be 3.9)
- Verify requirements.txt is valid
- Test build locally: `pyinstaller ZyraVideoAgentBackend-minimal.spec --clean`

### Issue: Tests fail
**Solution**:
- Run tests locally: `python tests/test_dist_build/run_all_tests.py`
- Check test_report.json for details
- Verify dist/ZyraVideoAgentBackend/ exists with executable

### Issue: Can't approve deployment
**Solution**:
- Verify environments are created
- Check you're added as required reviewer
- Ensure branch is `main` (canary/production only run on main)

### Issue: Artifacts not found
**Solution**:
- Verify previous job completed successfully (green checkmark)
- Check artifact naming matches workflow
- Ensure retention period hasn't expired
