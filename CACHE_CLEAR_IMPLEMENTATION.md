# Splice Cache Clear Button - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Ready for testing

---

## üéØ **WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED**

I've added a **"Clear Splice Cache"** button to your Settings page that removes all cached splice video clips. This forces the system to re-process all clips with the current (fixed) code instead of using potentially corrupted cached versions.

---

## üìÅ **FILES MODIFIED**

### 1. **Backend: `/backend/app.py`**

Added two new API endpoints:

#### **POST /api/cache/clear-splice**
- Clears the entire splice clip cache
- Returns statistics: files removed, space freed

#### **GET /api/cache/splice-stats**
- Gets current cache statistics
- Returns: file count, total size, cache directory

**Location:** Lines 3845-3898

---

### 2. **Frontend: `/frontend/src/renderer/src/utils/api.js`**

Added two new API functions:

```javascript
export const clearSpliceCache = async () => { ... }
export const getSpliceCacheStats = async () => { ... }
```

**Location:** Lines 410-434

---

### 3. **Frontend: `/frontend/src/renderer/src/pages/SettingsPage.jsx`**

Added:
- Import statements for new API functions
- State variables for cache stats and loading state
- `loadCacheStats()` function - loads cache info on mount
- `handleClearSpliceCache()` function - clears cache and shows results
- UI component in "Debug & Support" section

**Location:** 
- Imports: Line 19-20
- State: Lines 75-77
- Functions: Lines 257-296
- UI: Lines 1582-1614

---

## üé® **UI FEATURES**

The new cache management section shows:

1. **Cache Statistics:**
   - Number of cached files
   - Total storage used (in GB)
   - Updates automatically

2. **Clear Cache Button:**
   - Shows loading spinner when clearing
   - Disabled when cache is empty
   - Provides success feedback

3. **Success Message:**
   - Shows files removed count
   - Shows space freed amount
   - Auto-dismisses after 5 seconds

4. **Empty State:**
   - Shows message when cache is empty
   - Explains cache will populate as videos are created

---

## üöÄ **HOW TO USE**

### **For Users:**

1. Open app
2. Go to **Settings** page
3. Scroll to **"Debug & Support"** section
4. Find **"Splice Video Cache"** panel
5. Click **"Clear Cache"** button
6. Wait for confirmation message
7. Run a new splice campaign to test

### **Expected Messages:**

**Success:**
```
Cache cleared successfully! Removed 13 files (2.4GB freed)
```

**Empty Cache:**
```
Cache is empty. It will populate as you create splice videos.
```

**Error:**
```
Failed to clear cache: [error details]
```

---

## üîç **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU CLEAR CACHE**

### **Before Clear:**
```
~/.zyra-video-agent/clip-cache/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ a4b3c2d1.mp4  (Cached, possibly corrupted)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ e5f6g7h8.mp4  (Cached, possibly corrupted)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (13 more files)
```

### **After Clear:**
```
~/.zyra-video-agent/clip-cache/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (empty)
```

### **Next Video Generation:**
- All clips processed fresh
- New cache entries created
- Uses current (fixed) code
- No corruption from old cached files

---

## üí° **WHY THIS FIXES YOUR ISSUES**

### **The Problem:**

From your logs:
```
üíæ Cache hits: 13 (instant)
üîÑ Resized: 2
```

**93% of clips came from cache!** If those 13 clips were cached when you had broken audio removal code, they're corrupted and used in every video.

### **The Solution:**

Clearing cache:
1. Removes all 13+ cached clips
2. Forces re-processing with current code
3. Creates fresh, non-corrupted cache
4. Next videos use good clips

### **Expected Outcome:**

If cache corruption was the main issue:
- ‚úÖ Freeze frames disappear
- ‚úÖ Audio pops disappear
- ‚úÖ Voiceover sync issues disappear
- ‚úÖ Duration matches expected length

## üß™ **TESTING INSTRUCTIONS**

### **Step 1: Clear Cache**

1. Go to Settings
2. Scroll to "Splice Video Cache" section
3. Note current cache size (e.g., "13 files ‚Ä¢ 2.4GB")
4. Click "Clear Cache"
5. Wait for success message
6. Verify it says "0 files ‚Ä¢ 0GB"

### **Step 2: Run Test Campaign**

1. Go to Campaigns page
2. Find your test splice campaign (the one with issues)
3. Click "Run" button
4. Wait for completion
5. Watch the output video

### **Step 3: Verify Results**

Check for improvements:
- ‚úÖ No freeze frames at clip transitions?
- ‚úÖ No audio pops?
- ‚úÖ Voiceover in sync?
- ‚úÖ Duration matches expected?

### **Step 4: Report Findings**

**If issues are FIXED:**
- ‚úÖ Cache corruption was the culprit
- ‚úÖ No further action needed
- ‚úÖ Use cache clear button if issues return

**If issues PERSIST:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cache wasn't the only problem
- üîß Need to implement Option B (re-encode trims)
- üìã See `SPLICE_ISSUES_DIAGNOSIS.md` for next steps

## üìä **CACHE BEHAVIOR**

### **Automatic Cache Management:**

The cache already has built-in limits:

```python
MAX_CACHE_SIZE_GB = 10  # Auto-cleanup after 10GB
```

When cache exceeds 10GB:
- Oldest files are removed first (LRU)
- Cleans down to 8GB (80% of limit)
- Happens automatically during processing

### **Cache Key Structure:**

Clips are cached based on:
```python
cache_key = hash(clip_path + mtime + canvas_size + crop_mode)
```

Cache is invalidated automatically if:
- Source file is modified (mtime changes)
- Canvas size changes
- Crop mode changes

Cache is NOT invalidated if:
- Audio processing changes (YOUR ISSUE)
- Encoding parameters change
- Internal corruption occurs

**That's why manual clearing is needed after code changes!**

---

## üîÆ **FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS**

### **Version-Based Cache:**

Add version to cache key to auto-invalidate on code changes:

```python
# In clip_cache.py
CACHE_VERSION = "2.0"  # Bump when audio processing changes
cache_key = hash(f"{clip_path}_{mtime}_{CACHE_VERSION}_{...}")
```

### **Cache Health Monitoring:**

Add warnings when:
- Cache is over 7 days old
- Cache size exceeds 5GB
- Detected clip corruption

### **Auto-Clear Options:**

Add settings:
- [ ] Auto-clear cache on app update
- [ ] Auto-clear cache older than X days
- [ ] Show cache age warning

## üéì **KEY TAKEAWAYS**

1. **Cache is powerful but dangerous** - Speed comes at cost of potential corruption
2. **Always test with cache cleared** - Ensures you're testing current code
3. **Version your cache** - Add encoding parameters to cache key
4. **Monitor cache health** - Check age, size, corruption regularly
5. **Clear after major changes** - Especially audio/video processing changes

## üÜò **IF ISSUES PERSIST**

After clearing cache, if problems continue:

1. **Read full diagnosis:** `backend/bugs/SPLICE_ISSUES_DIAGNOSIS.md`
2. **Test Option D first:** Set `original_volume=0.0` (quick test)
3. **Implement Option B:** Pre-trim during normalize (best solution)
4. **Contact support:** Attach diagnostic report from Settings
